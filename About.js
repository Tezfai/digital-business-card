      <p>
I’m a frontend developer who enjoys building clean and user-friendly interfaces. I like taking on small projects that let me experiment with new tools and design ideas, and I’m always looking for ways to make my code more efficient. Outside of coding, I spend time learning about different parts of tech so I can keep improving and stay up to date with best practices.
